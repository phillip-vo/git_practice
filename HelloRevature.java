/*
	Java compile to bytecode which is run within the Java Virtual Machine JVM
	Virtual Machine: virtual machine is a walled-off operating system within an operating system
	Because we are running in the Java Virtual Machine, Java is what we call "Write one, run anywhere"
	The JVM is independent of the operatin system: so we can use Java the same way on Windows, Mac, Linux
	
	Benefits of Java:
	Automatic garbage collection

	Very safe, reusable

	Java is one of those things that's popular because it's popular
	(because Java has a very intense amount of standardization thanks to the JVM)

	
	The enviroment that Java exists in is consistent everywhere because of the JRE, JVM
